- **Rahul** (19/01/2025): Have you tried external keyboard to rule out software issue?
- **Amit** (19/01/2025): External keyboard works fine. So it's definitely a hardware issue
- **Priya** (19/01/2025): Which laptop is it? Some have known keyboard issues

- **Rahul** (16/01/2025): Those are headphones not earbuds 😅 But I agree Sony makes great audio stuff
- **Priya** (16/01/2025): Oops lol. For earbuds, I'd say the Sony WF-1000XM5 are the best. Same great ANC in earbud form
- **Priya** (16/01/2025): For calls specifically, Jabra Elite 85t are excellent. Used them for all my meetings
- **Neha** (18/01/2025): Heads up - Amazon has the Sony WH-1000XM5 on sale! ₹22,990 down from ₹29,990
- **Priya** (20/01/2025): I have the Roomba and it's been solid. The obstacle avoidance is impressive

- **Rahul** (15/01/2025): Phones right now! Any recommendations Neha?
- **Neha** (15/01/2025): I recently got the OnePlus 12. Best value flagship in my opinion. The charging speed is insane - 0 to 100 in like 25 minutes
